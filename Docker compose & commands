1. Introduction to Docker Compose
What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. Using a single YAML configuration file (docker-compose.yml), you can define your services and control them with simple commands to start or stop your entire application.

Key Commands:

docker-compose up — Starts and runs all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
docker-compose down — Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes.

What is YAML?
YAML, or "Yet Another Markup Language," is used for configuration files. It’s human-readable and makes setting up configurations in Docker Compose files easier. YAML files typically have .yml or .yaml extensions.

2. Sample docker-compose.yml

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

3. Docker Commands for Container Management
Pull a Docker Image and Run as Non-Root User
Pull Docker Image:

docker pull nginx
Run Container as a Non-Root User:

Add the current user to the Docker group to avoid using sudo for each command:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Reboot to apply changes:
sudo reboot

Run the Docker Container:
docker run -d nginx

Inspect and Manage Containers
Inspect the Container’s Processes and Ports:


docker inspect <container_name>
View Logs for a Container:


docker logs <container_name>
Start and Stop Containers:


docker stop <container_name>
docker start <container_name>
Remove a Container:


docker rm <container_name>
